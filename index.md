## Overview

GitProbe is a simple yet powerful tool designed to enhance your experience with GitHub. By replacing 'hub' with 'probe' in any GitHub URL, you can obtain a codebase structure that is friendly for large language models (LLMs). This functionality allows developers to better understand and navigate code repositories, making it easier to integrate AI into their workflows.

## Installation

To get started with GitProbe, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/qmuse/gitprobe/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system, and execute it to install GitProbe.

## Usage

Using GitProbe is straightforward. Simply take any GitHub URL and replace 'hub' with 'probe'. For example:

- Original URL: `https://github.com/user/repo`
- Transformed URL: `https://probe.github.com/user/repo`

This transformation allows you to access a codebase structure that is optimized for AI interaction.

### Example

1. Take the URL: `https://github.com/qmuse/gitprobe`
2. Change it to: `https://probe.github.com/qmuse/gitprobe`
3. Access the new URL to see the AI-friendly codebase structure.
